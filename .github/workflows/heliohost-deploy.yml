          # Actually, the user wants the build to govern. 
          # BUT Laravel needs index.php to run.
          # Vue build usually produces index.html.
          # If we overwrite index.html, we need Laravel to serve it or rewrite to it.
          # Let's assume the user handles the serving logic in Laravel routes as discussed.
